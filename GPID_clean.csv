To the right is seen a dilapidated arched Brick Oven, such as was formerly used by the Low-German Boors, for baking black bread.  This is a splendid example of the Master; is finished in his very highest manner, and is marked with his initials, A. C.  The universality of Cuyp's genius is well known.  His vigilant attention to nature, under every guise and aspect, enabled him to excel in every thing he undertook.  In this most exquisite gem, for instance, however humble and unpromising the subject, he has managed to produce a work, fitted to adorn the collection of a prince.

On the right of the picture, upon the rising ground, is a Group of Fishwomen with creels ready to convey away the fish.  A man on a Grey Horse, accompanied by two Dogs, is in the act of making a bargain with one of the Fishermen, (who is standing with his hands in his breast, listening indifferently,) either for the cargo of fish, or to convey a quantity of casks to one of the cruizers which are sailing about; the Man is referring to the Woman, supposed to be his wife, who is in her turn addressing the person on Horseback.  An Old Man, and a little Girl are drawing up a Basket containing provisions; a Waggon with two horses going towards the group, closes this side of the picture.  On the left are three Fishing Boats just come in, a number of figures close upon the sea, which is receding, are catching shrimps and sandeels.  In the front of the picture is a beautiful Sandy Beach; the day is serene and the sky full of warmth.  Its predominant tender tones are varied with the most beautiful gradations of tint that genius and art could blend together; the figures are admirably drawn, and the finishing throughout is of the most exquisite description.  This is a captivating picture and undoubtedly ranks in the very highest class of this great Master's works; it has been held by many to be the genuine production of Philip Wouwermans.
