###Data sets for digital mapping workshop

A note on these, some of these are a bit messy and won’t work perfectly. That is deliberate! No data set arrives perfectly formed unless someone else has already done all the hard work. We will look at how to tidy them up. 

Some will make more interesting maps than others, we can chat about what is worth mapping or what else is needed to make a useful visualisation.

Some can be used for more than one exercise. 

##For Google Maps use one of the following

Accused Witches data set (source Salem Witchcraft Dataset, Professor Richard Latner of Tulane University, https://kaggle.com/rtatman/salem-witchcraft-dataset)
GPID_clean.csv (source Getty Provenance Index Database https://github.com/chnm/doingdh/blob/master/GPID_clean.csv)
2011-auction-trends-data.csv (source Getty Provenance Index Database https://github.com/chnm/doingdh)
Cushman-collection.csv (Miriam Posner https://github.com/miriamposner/palladio_workshop/blob/master/Cushman-Collection.csv
Vic Heritage Database - Vhd.xlsx (Scraped and compiled from https://vhd.heritagecouncil.vic.gov.au/)
Ww2-places.csv (Source https://www.data.qld.gov.au/dataset/world-war-ii-historic-places-in-queensland/resource/cbd1aa53-38f3-414d-9ed2-29623047ac23)
Artists-and-organisations-in-qagoma-collection-as-at-30-june-2018.csv (Source https://www.data.qld.gov.au/dataset/qagoma-artists-and-organisations)

Others that need some tidying to use (location data required)
Saphotographs1950onwards.csv << needs better location data. Try editing a section for Palladio. (Source Data SA https://data.sa.gov.au/data/dataset/south-australian-photographs/resource/11098c97-755a-4681-a915-2d2a9819e188)
Shipwrecks data - Sheet1.csv << Needs better location data (Source New Jersey Shipwrecks http://blackwhale.com/shipwreckdatabase.html)

##For Palladio you need a csv or similar with a column of latlong coordinates, use

Cushman-collection.csv (optimised for Palladio)

And/or edit one of the Google Maps datasets to include the correct location column (see slides about geocoding). Feel free to edit just a portion of a dataset.

##For Recogito you need a narrative text use one of the following (or find your own at Gutenberg)

Frankenstein (via Gutenberg)
Cooks Journals (via Adelaide ebooks)
Laurence Sterne (via Gutenberg)

##For Georeferencing you need an image of a historic map 

Use jpg, png, or tiff and use a decent resolution so your final layer isn’t pixelated (eg 2000 x 2000 or larger, 2-3MB or larger), see suggested maps or find your own at the following.

State Library of Victoria https://www.slv.vic.gov.au/search-discover/explore-collections-format/maps
NLA Maps https://www.nla.gov.au/what-we-collect/maps

You can try adding several small maps that cover a similar area, like these fire insurance plans
